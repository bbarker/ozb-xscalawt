This is an example project to see https://github.com/ozeebee/ozb-xscalawt[ozb-xscalawt^] in action.

== Steps

. Install https://github.com/ozeebee/ozb-xscalawt[ozb-xscalawt^] and Eclipse libraries in your local repository
. Configure the https://github.com/ozeebee/ozb-xscalawt/blob/master/example/build.sbt[build.sbt] file to use the correct SWT library for your OS (Mac OS X by default)
